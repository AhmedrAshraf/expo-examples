- Run [`expo start`](https://docs.expo.io/versions/latest/workflow/expo-cli/), try it out.

## FAQ

If the following commands fail, you can get better debug info by running a subset command:

- `yarn e2e:ios`: `yarn ios` (builds the iOS app). xcodebuild compile errors may show in a more helpful format (using xcpretty).
- `yarn e2e:android`: `yarn android` (builds the Android app). Android compile errors may show in a more helpful format.

### `yarn e2e:android` failed

If you get the error:

```sh
detox[98696] ERROR: DetoxRuntimeError: Cannot boot Android Emulator with the name: 'Pixel_API_28'

HINT: Make sure you choose one of the available emulators: Pixel_3_API_30,Pixel_3a_API_30,Pixel_C_API_30
```

Be sure to change the first emulator name (in my case "Pixel_API_28") with one of the suggested emulators (in my case Pixel_3_API_30, Pixel_3a_API_30, Pixel_C_API_30), in the `detox.config.js` file under `devices.emulator.device.avdName`. More emulators can be created in Android Studio.

If you get the error:

```sh
Error: app binary not found at '/Users/.../with-detox/android/app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk', did you build it
```

It means the build step failed, ensure running `yarn android`, and `yarn build:android` works before trying `yarn e2e:android` again.

---

If you get the error:

```sh
PKIX path building failed: sun.security.provider.certpath.SunCertPathBuilderException: unable to find valid certification path to requested target
```

Be sure to disable any proxies running on your computer that may be blocking requests (i.e. Charles Proxy). You may need to run `yarn clean:android` before attempting to build again.
